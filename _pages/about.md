I'm an Aerospace Engineer working on autonomous vehicles (AVs) in [Toronto, Canada](https://www.seetorontonow.com/). My expertise lies in robotics and spacecraft engineering, particularly in estimation/control, [GNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guidance,_navigation,_and_control) design and astrodynamics.

I completed both my BASc and MASc from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) by way of the [National Scholarship](https://future.utoronto.ca/scholarships/national-scholarship-program/) and [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) programs. Rather than follow a traditional academic path, I turned down not one, but two fully funded doctorate programs early in my career. Instead, for 10+ years at the [Space Flight Laboratory](https://www.utias-sfl.net/), I pioneered Earth Observation missions on small-satellite platforms and made [original contributions](https://www.najmusibrahim.com/space) to Canada's space sector. I chose and was privileged to work with mentors who themselves engineered Canadarm2 and were trained by the architects of the Apollo moon missions. I've had the opportunity to negotiate contracts and engineer a variety of spacecraft missions for Canada (DRDC, [Kepler](https://www.keplercommunications.com/), [GHGSat](https://www.ghgsat.com/our-platforms/)) and its international partners. I have even made contributions towards [NASA/ESA interplanetary missions](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/) (to Saturn's largest moon, Titan), helped publish books on space telescopes and competed as one of the [top 72 finalists](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/recruitment/profiles.asp?ibrahim-najmus) in [CSA's 2017 Call for Astronauts](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/how-to-become-an-astronaut/process-2017/) --all while still in my 20s.

Having run the spacecraft engineering gamut, I am currently a member of the **Prediction** engineering team at [Oxa](https://oxa.tech/) working to make AVs an everyday reality. I remain invested in the Space industry and and continue to provide GNC training/services for academia and industry in Canada. In Toronto, I am regularly involved in outreach activities which sit at the intersection of modern engineering, the advancement of careers in STEM, [exploration](https://www.najmusibrahim.com/exploration) and upward mobility for under-represented groups.
