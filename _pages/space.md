Over the last 10+ years, I have ran the spacecraft engineering gamut in various technical and leadership capacities. I remain invested in the Space industry and and continue to provide GNC training/services for academia and industry in Canada.

I have contributed to joint [NASA and ESA interplanetary missions](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/) ([Cassini/Huygens](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063310002862)) sent beyond Mars and helped develop over 10 satellites, many for which I was directly responsible as the lead Guidance, Navigation and Control ([GNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guidance,_navigation,_and_control)) engineer. My designs, algorithms and contributions are utilized on the following spacecraft, many of which are currently operating in space.

* Kepler GEN1 Cluster ([Kepler](https://www.keplercommunications.com/)) - IoT
* GHGSat-D/C ([GHGSat](https://www.ghgsat.com/)) - Greenhouse gas sensing
* Hawkeye Pathfinder ([HawkEye](https://www.he360.com/)) - RF mapping
* Gray Jay Constellation ([DRDC](https://www.canada.ca/en/defence-research-development.html)) - Military R&D
* AISSat-1/2 ([FFI](https://www.ffi.no/en)) - Maritime vessel detection
* DMSat-1 ([MBRSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_bin_Rashid_Space_Centre))- Aerosol remote sensing
* EV-9 ([exactEarth](https://www.exactearth.com/)) - Maritime vessel detection
* NEMO-HD ([Space-SI](https://www.space.si/en/microsatellite/)) - Earth observation
* CanX-4/5 ([DRDC](https://www.canada.ca/en/defence-research-development.html)) - Formation flying

## Spacecraft Engineering

As the GNC lead for multiple satellite missions, I have direct experience from Phase 0 (mission identification) to Phase E (utilization) of the [standard mission lifetime cycle](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/How_a_mission_is_chosen). My responsibilities varied from negotiating ITAR contracts and leading design reviews to attitude control system (ACS) design, hardware calibration and on-orbit commissioning. My extensive record also includes pioneering remote sensing missions at the [Space Flight Laboratory](https://www.utias-sfl.net/), where this technology is used to track the Earth at accuraces up to **20 arcminutes** (from 650 km). My work has been published in [Optical Payloads for Space Missions](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118945179.ch40) (John Wiley & Sons, 2016) and international conferences where I have represented Canada. A comprehensive representation of my skills and experience is shown below.
